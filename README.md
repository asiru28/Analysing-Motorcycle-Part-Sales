# Analysing Motorcycle Part Sales

# Overview/Introduction

This project involves analysing sales data for a company that sells motorcycle parts. The company operates three warehouses and deals with both retail and wholesale clients. The goal is to calculate net revenue for each product line, focusing on wholesale orders, and to analyse how this revenue varies month-to-month and across different warehouses.

# Objectives

- Calculate net revenue for each product line, grouped by month and warehouse.
- Filter the data to include only wholesale orders.
- Provide insights into the performance of different product lines across warehouses and months.

# Data Source

The data is sourced from the companyâ€™s database, which contains a table named sales. This table includes details such as order number, date, warehouse, client type, product line, quantity, unit price, total price, payment method, and payment fee.

# Tools Used
